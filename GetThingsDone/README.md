# Pre-work - GetThingsDone

**GetThingsDone** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including
- adding new items
- editing existing items
- deleting existing items

Submitted by: Kalyan

Time spent: around 3-4 hours

The following **required** functionality is completed:
* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

## Notes
- Most of the time was spent in understanding small Android details like EditText alignment, etc.
- Getting used to making Android Studio add the onClick handler skeleton code took a while
- Understanding Adapters, AdapterView was interesting and spent some time reading about it
- Still see a bunch of some wifi error messages thrown by Android Studio, but the app itself seems to run fine
